# FOBOS
## Introduction
This is information on how to simulate FOBOS spectra. Here you will find code to finding flux/magnitude of sample objects. The sample objects come from the COSMOS ACS Mosaic Tiles (http://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/data/COSMOS/images/acs_mosaic_2.0/). The goal is to simulate mock spectra and renormalize based on the sample objects taken from ACS. 

## DESI Dependency
In order to run the simulation we will use some DESI code, specifically specsim and desimodel.
